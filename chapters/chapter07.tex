\section{Winograd Schema}

Winograd schemas are named after Terry Winograd. The idea is that there is a sentence presented that has two meanings. A computer finds these sentences challenging to understand, and that makes them interesting for the development of Artificial Intelligence.

An example follows.

\begin{center}
	\textbf{He didn't put the trophy in the suitcase because it was too [big/small]}
\end{center}

We can choose which bracketed term to use, and we must choose only one bracketed term. If we choose `big' then we are referring to the trophy. If we choose `small' then we are referring to the suitcase. Human beings can easily see the pronoun `it' refers to either the suitcase or the trophy. Computers have trouble with these determinations.

The Transformer, and the Scaled Dot-product Attention that it uses, lends itself to discussion of Winograd schema. Remember that the Attention scheme compares tokens to other tokens in the same sentence. 

In the chatbot example, we are less interested in the Winograd example because it doesn't come up often. However, in the case of the Generative Pre-training Transformer 2, and it's exhaustive training, it is interesting to consider the Winograd style example sentences.

There is a Winograd Schema Challenge and something of a formula for constructing your own Winograd schema (Wikapedia contributors). \cite{wiki:xxx}

Though it is not a classic Winograd schema, when we test the x-large GPT2 model in chapter \ref{chapter-xlarge}, we ask the model how many members there are in the band `The Beatles' without specifying which band we are talking about. The x-large model answers what could be an ambiguous question. Sometimes it answers correctly.
