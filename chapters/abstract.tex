We are interested in making a chat-bot. We want a computer program that can answer questions that might come up in a simple conversation.

We experiment with the Transformer Neural Network model and we try to explain in this paper how one works.

We chronicle a few experiments in Natural Language Processing. We try a Gated Recurrent Unit based chatbot. We try a transformer based chatbot. We also try the `Generative Pre-training Transformer 2' model as a chatbot. 

We are also interested in installing the chatbot code on a small computer like a Raspberry Pi with speech recognition and speech-to-text software. In this way we might be able to create a device which speaks and which you can speak to. For the Gated Recurrent Unit based model we can use a Raspberry Pi 3B. In the case of the Generative Pre-training Transformer 2 the running chatbot model uses too much ram, so we try to install it on a Raspberry Pi 4B. The Generative Pre-training Transformer 2 does not fit on a Raspberry Pi 3B.
