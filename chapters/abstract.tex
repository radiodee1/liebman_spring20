Our goal in this thesis is to create a chatbot, a computer program that can respond verbally to a human in the course of simple day-to-day conversations.

We use a deep learning neural network model called the Transformer to develop the chatbot. A full description of a Transformer is provided. We show  the use of a few different Transformer-based Natural Language Processing models to develop the chatbot, including  Generative Pre-Training 2 (GPT2). For comparison we include a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based model. Each of these are explained below.

We are also interested in installing the chatbot code on a small device  such as the Raspberry Pi with speech recognition and speech-to-text software. In this way we might be able to create a device that can carry out a verbal conversation with a human. For the GRU-based model we can use a Raspberry Pi 3B with 1GB RAM. A Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM is needed to run a chatbot with the GPT2.
