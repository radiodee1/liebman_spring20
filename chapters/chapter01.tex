\section{Background}

In their paper Vinyals et al (2015)\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/VinyalsL15} discuss making a chatbot using
a neural network configured for sequence to sequence neural machine
translation. We code our own sequence to sequence chatbot, though our results are less than
spectacular. As our hand coded model does not run sufficiently well, we use code authored by Matthew Inkawhich (2018)\cite{2018Inkawhich}.

In their paper Vaswani et al (2017)\cite{Vaswani2017AttentionIA} discuss using the Transformer architecture for solving machine learning tasks. We train a transformer model as a chatbot.


Also Radford et al (2019)\cite{radford2019language} discuss the GPT2 neural network for NLP tasks. The GPT2 model is based largely on the Transformer architecture. GPT2 stands for 'Generative Pre-training Transformer 2'. 

We implement a chatbot with a GPT2 model. We use a program library from Wolf et al (2019)\cite{Wolf2019HuggingFacesTS} to run our model.


It is worth noting that with the appearance of the Transformer architecture and WordPiece vocabulary scheme, some technologies have become redundant or obsolete. This may be true of any model that uses RNN components and also the traditional word vector embeddings.

\section{Recurrent Neural Network Components}

\subsection*{Overview (RNN)}
The goal behind RNN components is to detect patterns. Here we explore a simple RNN.

The simplest RNN has two inputs and two outputs. They can be arranged in chains. In our example the input will be a sequence of data and the RNN chain will be a line of components of the same length.

One input from each component is the hidden state output from the RNN to the left. Another input is the current input from the sequence that the chain is monitoring. One output is the generated hidden state, meant for the component to the right. The last output is the value that the RNN surmises. 

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption[Recurrent Neural Network]{RNN - 1 and 2 are inputs, 3 is the output.}
	
	%\addcontentsline{lof}{section}{Recurrent Neural Network}
\end{figure}

In our diagram the two inputs are labeled on the left side, and the single output does double duty as both the hidden state output and the value that the RNN surmises.

There are several designs for an RNN component. The inner workings of these components are what makes them different. In the example in the diagram the inner workings are very simple. Two paths, labeled as inputs, take data into the RNN. Their data is combined in the green circle. This combination is done with concatination and simple feed forward neural network components. The output from the concatination is passed through the red circle. This is a tanh activation operation that limits the output to values from -1 through 1. This tanh activation keeps the output within reasonable values. Finally the output is delivered outside the component to the program employing the RNN. In this diagram there is only one output. The single output would serve as both the hidden state output for that position in the chain, and also the data output component for that position in the chain.



\subsection*{Specific (GRU)}
A second type of RNN is the GRU. GRU stands for 'Gated Recurrent Unit'. A GRU has two inputs and two outputs. The formulas for a GRU, as outlined by Denny Britz in the website WILDML (Britz 2015)\cite{2015Britz}, are as follows.


$$ z =\sigma(x_tU^z + s_{t-1} W^z) $$  
$$ r =\sigma(x_t U^r +s_{t-1} W^r) $$  
$$ h = tanh(x_t U^h + (s_{t-1} \circ r) W^h) $$  
$$ s_t = (1 - z) \circ h + z \circ s_{t-1} $$  


The GRU has two inputs and two outputs. It also has two internal gates. One internal gate is the 'reset' gate. This one determines how much of the previous input is combined with the new value calculated by the mechanism of the GRU. It is denoted as '$r$' above. Another internal gate is the 'update' gate. The update gate decides how much new information is to be included in gate computation. It is denoted as '$z$'.

Here '$ s_t $' is the symbol for the output. '$h$' is the symbol for the 'hidden output'. The two inputs are '$ x_t $' and '$ s_{t-1} $' . '$ x_t $' is the hidden state input. '$ s_{t-1} $' is the regular input for the RNN or GRU. Sigmoid activation is used on the two gates, while tanh activation is used to compute the hidden output.

In the last line, the regular output is determined using the 'dot' product which is denoted with a circle, along with an addition operation. In the two gate formulas (the first and second) the output is determined as the sum of two matrix multiplication operations passed through sigmoid activation. This produces values in the range of 0 to 1.

Under most programming circumstances the GRU is not implemented by the average programmer. The programmer employs a language like python and a programming library like Pytorch or Tensorflow. The library then implements the GRU and makes it easy for the programmer to use that implementation.

\section{Sequence to Sequence}

Translating text from one language to another has become a common task for computers. The Sequence to Sequence architecture is often used today  for this purpose.

A naive approach to translation involves using a dictionary. You would encode each key as a word from one language and the value for that key would be the translated word in the target language. Of course this doesn't work, because different languages not only have different words for the same thing, but they also have different sentence structures for what might be similar concepts.

A better approach is sequence to sequence translation. A description follows with a section at the end for how training works.

In this approach we use recurrent neural networks to obtain our translation. Two recurrent neural network components are employed. One is responsible for the input language and the other for the output. Recurrent elements can remember sequences. 

Also employed are two vocabulary sets. One vocabulary is for the source language and another is for the target language. A table of word vectors the size of the input vocabulary is created and a maximum sentence length is picked. There is also a 'hidden size', which is an important dimension in the model. In practice the hidden size could be 300 units and more for this kind of application.

First text is prepared for training. A text corpus with source and target pairs is chosen. Sentences in the source corpus are paired with sentences with the same meaning in the target corpus. Sentence length is observed and for all sentences shorter than that length a special 'end-of-sequence' token is appended to all sequences in both languages.

Word vectors are created composed of floating point numbers. Each word in the vocabulary is translated to an integer which remains the same throughout the use of the translator. The word vectors are arranged in a table of floating point numbers with one dimension being the size of the input vocabulary and one dimension being the hidden size for the vector.

\subsection*{Recurrent Elements}
The recurrent unit in this case is a GRU. This stands for Gated Recurrent Unit. The GRU takes as input a single vector. It processes the vector and returns another vector. This could be
exactly the same as the input but is usually somehow changed. The input vector and the output vector have the
dimension of the 'hidden size' mentioned above. Throughout the discussion of this model the hidden size will remain the same. The GRU also operates on two hidden states. One hidden state, a vector, is taken in and another hidden state, also a vector, is produced for output.

So far the model takes a word, translates it to an integer, and finds the vector in the word embedding table that represents that word. It does this for the first word and all subsequent words one by one. Then it gives the entire vector for a word to the GRU. The GRU takes the word and passes it to some inner components. It decides weather to return as output just the input or the input modified. This is what the GRU does internally.

The input segments composed of GRUs take two input vectors and return two output vectors. One input is the vector from the embedding table. Another input vector is the hidden state. The hidden state is the same size as the input from the embedding table, but typically it comes from the previous input GRU. One output vector is like the word vector that's input to the GRU. One output vector is a hidden value.

The first word in the input sentence is converted to a vector and passed to the first GRU. The GRU has two inputs and two outputs. One input is for new data and one is for the hidden state of the segment in question. 

The very first GRU in the input chain ignores the fact that the first word has no hidden value. It consumes the first word vector. Then it passes it's output to the next GRU in the chain. This GRU uses the output of the previous GRU as the hidden value. It also uses the vector for the second word. It passes it's important information to the GRU to it's right. Then the last GRU in the chain passes it's hidden state to the output chain.

Later we will use GRUs to construct output segments. Here we want to stress that the inputs cascade from GRU to GRU in the input segment. 

The first GRU consumes the first word. The second GRU takes the hidden state from the first GRU along with the second word and consumes them. The third GRU takes the hidden output from the second GRU and the third word and consumes them. This pattern is repeated for the length of the input sentence. One at a time all the words from the input sentence are passed to the input GRU. The hidden state from the last GRU is passed to the output segment. The output segment is also GRU based.

A complicating detail is that although many GRUs are called for in the input segment they all use the same set of weights and 
biases. For this reason only a single input GRU is used for all of the words in practice. Outputs are calculated and then cycled around and fed with the next word from the sentence in vector form to the input of the GRU. 


The output chain is in charge of generating tokens that represent the input in the output language. The output uses GRU segments also. The first hidden input for the first output is taken from the 
last hidden output of the last recursive unit of the input chain. It is important because it is the spot where a great amount of data is passed from the input section to the output section. 
The connection at this point is said to carry the 'thought vector'. Most of the information responsible for translating one language to another is passed at this point.

The hidden values from the input section are passed to the first output GRU. It outputs the values that are later converted to the first word of the output. The first output GRU also has a hidden state. It passes the first word and the hidden state on to the second GRU.

The second GRU generates the second word and also its own hidden state. The second word is recorded and the word and the hidden state are passed on the the next GRU. This is repeated until a special 'end-of-sequence' token is found or until the number of tokens equals the maximum number allowed.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Output Tokens}
Each output we have is currently in the form of a vector. These vectors are a long string of floating point numbers, each one the dimensions of the 'hidden size' mentioned above. What's done with them is they are converted to the dimensions of the output vocabulary. Then they are processed in what is called an 'arg-max' function. This processing determines the index of the maximum value in the new vocabulary sized vector. This index allows the program to look up the corresponding word in the output vocabulary. This word is then used as the model output at that point in the output chain.

How does the model know what target vocabulary indexes go at what point in the output? For this we refer back to the corpus that we already have. One part of the corpus is the source language. The other part is the target language. A sentence is applied to the input and for that sentence an output is generated. The output is called a prediction. If the target and the prediction are not the same, the model must modify itself so that in the future they are.

There are some inherent problems. Because the output of a GRU is constantly being reused as the input, lots of data that might be useful to have is lost when the GRU churns through internal operations where several matrix multiplication operations are performed together on input. With every iteration more data is lost and so, for example, the effective length of the input and output sentences must be short. 

Another problem is that all input to be translated to target output has to be boiled down and 
passed to the output section through a small corridor the size of a typical word vector. This channel is sometimes referred to as the 'thought vector.' Somehow all necessary information must be there. This also limits the length of the input and output vectors. It does help, when setting
up a model for later training, to make the hidden size larger, but it only helps so much. There is a point at which the benefit of increasing the hidden size is lost.

That ends our discussion of Sequence to Sequence Translation. This is how some computer models do language translation. Using arg-max is an example of a greedy approach. Another approach might use something like 'Beam Selection' but we're not going to get into that here.


\section{Loss and Accuracy}

At first the prediction from a model is not very close to the desired output. The output is compared to the prediction and a 'loss' is generated. 'Loss' measures the difference between the predicted output and the target. A larger loss represents two values, prediction and target, that are further apart. The loss function must be chosen. 

%A typical loss function is 'Mean Squared Error' or MSE.

Another metric is Accuracy. 'Accuracy' is a numerical representation of the difference between the desired output and the generated prediction. It is a percentage of the time that the output is exactly correct.

Getting a prediction, running input data through a neural network, is forward propagation.
Training, then, is a mathematical process involving backpropagagtion. Backpropagation identifies areas of the model weights that need to be modified in order to get the proper prediction in the future.

%\iffalse
In practice we take the derivative of the loss function in order to backpropagate. The derivative is multiplied by the learning rate and subtracted from the original weight value. The result is a set of adjusted weight matrices. When these matrices are used later they allow for better predictions. 
%\fi

This is done over and over with every source/target sentence pair. Slowly the model is changed and predictions start to match the target. That's training. The loss should decrease over time and the accuracy should increase.

There are several numerical metrics that we can record during training that tell us how our model is training. The loss, a mathematical calculation of the difference between the model's output and the predicted value, is mentioned above. Loss is an important number. Also accuracy is important. Accuracy is a mathematical calculation of the difference between the model's output and the value that output should be, but it focuses on the number of times the model comes out with a correct prediction verses how many output values there are in total.

\section{Attention Mechanism}

Here we consider a simple attention mechanism that is used in the Sequence to Sequence model by Inkawhich (2018)\cite{2018Inkawhich}. The concept for this attention comes from Luong et al (2015)\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/LuongPM15}.

Luong et al (2015)\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/LuongPM15} are interested in three kinds of calculation for their attention mechanism. The three methods use slowly increasing levels of complication. First they propose a method that just uses the dot product. Then they propose a method that just uses a field of weights. Finally they use a method that uses concatination, along with a field of weights and a pass through a tanh activation layer.

$$
\boldmath
score(h_t^ \text{,} \bar{h}_s) =
\begin{cases}
    h_t^\intercal \bar{h}_s & \text{dot} \\
	h_t^\intercal W_a \bar{h}_s & \text{general} \\
	v_a^\intercal \text{tanh}(W_a [h_t ; \bar{h}_s] ) & \text{concat}
\end{cases}
\unboldmath
$$

Here $h_t$ is the symbol for the output of the current decoder and $\bar{h}_s $ is the symbol for another output taken from the input encoder. This one is the entire set of encoder states. Inkawhich (2018)\cite{2018Inkawhich} uses the 'dot' variety.

The formula is used after the decoder GRU calculates it's hidden state. It is below.

$$ 
\boldmath
score = h_t^\intercal \bar{h}_s 
\unboldmath
$$ 

Basically the output of the current decoder is transposed. Then it is multiplied by the hidden value from the entire set of encoder states. The result is multiplied by the GRU decoder output, and then passed through a tanh activation layer.

\section{Sequence to Sequence Chatbot}

Vinyals et al (2015)\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/VinyalsL15} make an interesting proposition. They say that it's possible to make what they call a Neural Conversational Model by constructing a Sequence to Sequence model, but instead of using two corpus from different languages a single language is used for both source and target.

Chatbots have for a long time been constructed using AIML. AIML, (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) requires hand coding individual rules for every input and response. A Neural Conversational Model would not use those sorts of rules.

To create a model like this more is required than just a single input and output language. There must be a relationship between the source and the target. We want there to be a question-and-answer-like relation. Finding a corpus like this can be difficult.

It would be easy to duplicate the input source material in the target corpus. This would produce auto-encoding. The model would learn to repeat everything that was given to it in it's output. Though the model learns a task, it is not the dynamic task we want. Conversations, on the other hand, supply the relationship we are looking for. Starting with almost any question sentence in a conversation, the sentence following it answers the question posed. The latter fills a space that is opened up by the former. 

What would be a good candidate for this kind of verbal play? Vinyals et al (2015)\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/VinyalsL15} use a movie transcript dataset. Essentially they take movie dialogue and break it into sentences. Even numbered sentence are the source material, and odd numbered sentences are the target. Using this method there are times when the source and target are not from the same conversation, like times in a movie dialog when the scene switches from one locale to another. Comparing this, though, to the number of times that the two sentences are from the same dialogue, the movie transcript database serves very well.

Training for this model is relatively straight forward. There is a problem though. We can follow the loss and make sure it is decreasing, but the accuracy tells us nothing and in this case does not increase as we would like it to. The loss goes down but the accuracy does not go up.

\begin{figure}[H]
	
	\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{Figure_1}
	
	\caption[Loss and Accuracy]{Loss and Accuracy: Red is accuracy and blue is loss.}
	
	%\addcontentsline{lof}{section}{Loss and Accuracy}
\end{figure}

This is because the source and target do not have the same meaning. The model does learn the task at hand but during training we have to ignore the accuracy. Success is usually measured by the accuracy of the holdout test set. Here we must measure the success with a subjective examination of the trained model.

We have to interactively give the model questions that we might ask someone that we are having a conversation with, and then see how it answers. Over and over we have to test the model. If we are satisfied with the answers then the training was a success.
